          <h4 class="boxHeadline">Project Scope</h4>
          <p class="boxText"><a href="https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu/communities/" target="_blank">This project</a> began in
            2014 and aimed to study mental models of online communities (like forums, wikis, and subreddits) and
            understand how these mental models were formed, how they evolve, and how they shape expectations for the
            community. Prior to my involvement beginning in the fall of 2019, these online communities included
            Bootstrap Wikis and Reddit communities surrounding Bitcoin. The final research project on this grant, which
            I worked on, centered around Reddit communities for people experiencing infertility and trying to conceive.
            During the 2019-2020 school year and into the summer of 2020, I worked as part of a team on explorative
            qualitative coding of conversations within these subreddits to find patterns and themes in the language and
            described behavior of community members, particularly in relation to each other and in relation to the
            community itself, and then on writing two academic paper submissions, one for CHI 2020 and one for CSCW
            2020.</p>

          <h4 class="boxHeadline">Process</h4>
          <p class="boxText">I was a part of a team including PHD student Megan Knittel, Professor Rick Wash, and one
            other undergraduate research assistant, Abi. Throughout the first several months of the project, Megan, Abi,
            and I engaged in the iterative development of a codebook to categorize and capture the ideas present in the
            threads we were reading. We spent a lot of time coding threads separately with our current version of the
            codebook, and we met weekly to discuss the ideas each of us were finding and adjust the codes and their
            definitions. This explorative analysis was performed using NVivo, and after several months of qualitative
            coding, we developed a refined concept of what direction a paper about our findings might take. We used
            techniques like an affinity wall diagram to help ground our findings in the data. At the beginning of 2020,
            we worked on a submission for CHI 2020’s Late Breaking Work category, detailing the similarities and
            differences between the infertility subreddits and the previously studied Bitcoin subreddit. In the summer
            of 2020, our submission for CSCW 2020 focused on our findings about community members’ usage of
            self-tracking technologies and how the online community impacted their self-reported behavior and emotional
            responses to their data.</p>

                <p class="boxText"><a href="https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu/communities/" target="_blank">This project</a> began in 2014 and aimed to study mental models of online communities (like forums, wikis, and subreddits) and understand how these mental models were formed, how they evolve, and how they shape expectations for the community. Prior to my involvement beginning in the fall of 2019, these online communities included Bootstrap Wikis and Reddit communities surrounding Bitcoin. The final research project on this grant, which I worked on, centered around Reddit communities for people experiencing infertility and trying to conceive. During the 2019-2020 school year and into the summer of 2020, I worked as part of a team on explorative qualitative coding of conversations within these subreddits to find patterns and themes in the language and described behavior of community members, particularly in relation to each other and in relation to the community itself, and then on writing two academic paper submissions, one for CHI 2020 and one for CSCW 2020.</p>

                <p class="boxText">I was a part of a team including PHD student Megan Knittel, Professor Rick Wash, and one other undergraduate research assistant, Abi. Throughout the first several months of the project, Megan, Abi, and I engaged in the iterative development of a codebook to categorize and capture the ideas present in the threads we were reading. We spent a lot of time coding threads separately with our current version of the codebook, and we met weekly to discuss the ideas each of us were finding and adjust the codes and their definitions. This explorative analysis was performed using NVivo, and after several months of qualitative coding, we developed a refined concept of what direction a paper about our findings might take. We used techniques like an affinity wall diagram to help ground our findings in the data. At the beginning of 2020, we worked on a submission for CHI 2020’s Late Breaking Work category, detailing the similarities and differences between the infertility subreddits and the previously studied Bitcoin subreddit. In the summer of 2020, our submission for CSCW 2020 focused on our findings about community members’ usage of self-tracking technologies and how the online community impacted their self-reported behavior and emotional responses to their data.</p>

                <p class="boxText"><a href="https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu/securitystories/" target="_blank">This project</a> began in 2017 and aimed to explore how communicating security advice through stories could improve people’s security behavior ‘in the wild’.  This included developing models of real-life security decision behavior through interview studies and investigating the impact of stories in different cybersecurity contexts, including passwords, two-factor authentication, and for my central involvement, email. I was involved in three parts of this research project: coding security stories told in a survey study, aiding in transcription for a non-expert security decision making interview study, and spent most of my involvement developing and implementing an experimental protocol to test how story-based training affecting click rates on phishing emails. I began working on the experiment in May of 2020 and began running it in November of 2020.</p>

                <p class="boxText">The process of designing and actualizing an experiment took place in four main parts, which overlapped when problems arose and it became necessary to return to a previous step. Firstly, I engaged in literature review and learning about phishing emails, training, susceptibility, and experimental protocols. During this process, I gained a feel for the common problems, ethical concerns, gaps, and standards in the area of study. I revisited literature during all parts of the study, and I used it as a way to better inform my approach to problems that arose problems, along with consulting with my mentor, Dr. Wash. After the initial period of learning, I focused on developing a research question, hypothesis, and experiment design that would be most useful and feasible given our financial, time, and ethical constraints. After initially coming up with an experiment design, there was a long process going back and forth between design and development. During this period, I work with Dr. Wash and Norbert (a post-doctoral student working on the same grant) to address the technology side of running the experiment. At the beginning of the fall, I did several iterations of pilot testing, including running the study myself and doing a soft launch with ten participants to work out the kinks in the technology before moving on to the actual study launch.</p>

                <p class="boxText"><a href="https://www.spartansupportnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Spartan Support Network</a> is a student-led organization on MSU campus dedicated to providing safe spaces for students to talk openly and form genuine connections. It was founded in 2017 as a branch of the non-profit The Support Network, that facilitates and supports branches in (as of Fall 2020) eight schools across the country. The organization hosts weekly groups that take place at several times on several nights throughout the week that any MSU student can join. The weekly groups are led by group leaders, and the group leaders are supported and led by a board of directors. I was involved with SSN for two years, first as a member and then a group leader, before becoming the director of marketing. The scope of this position involved managing apparel, outreach, and social media. Prior to the summer of 2020, SSN had not had a cohesive visual brand that was developed consistently across its internet presence.</p>

                <h4 class="boxHeadline">Process</h4>
                <p class="boxText">As a part of my original interview process, I developed a marketing strategy to improve engagement and following on our Instagram and Facebook platforms. Beginning in May of 2020, I developed a unique visual brand for SSN, using a specific font package, color palette, and logo to unify the appearance of our posts. I sought direction from comparable social media presences of organization like Mental Health America, other MSU organizations, and other branches of The Support Network, along with conversations with the rest of the SSN directors, to develop a content strategy for SSN that fit with our mission statement and the role we wanted to play on campus. Throughout the summer of 2020 and the Fall 2020 Semester, I designed and implemented several Instagram and Facebook campaigns that aligned with our values as an organization, including content for Mental Health Awareness Month, Black Mental Health Awareness Month, BIPOC Mental Health Month, Leader Spotlight Saturdays, Monday Positivity, and a series of “Let’s Talk About it” posts focusing on student mental wellness topics. Outside of posts, I also sought to build our presence on campus as a mental wellness resource, and throughout the fall semester we have worked with or interfaced with organizations like the University Activities Board, ASMSU, Love Yourself Clothing, Impact Radio, OCAT, and Broad Student Orgs. </p>

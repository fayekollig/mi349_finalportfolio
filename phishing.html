          <p class="boxText"><a href="https://bitlab.cas.msu.edu/securitystories/" target="_blank">This project</a>
            began in 2017 and aimed to explore how communicating security advice through stories could improve people’s
            security behavior ‘in the wild’. This included developing models of real-life security decision behavior
            through interview studies and investigating the impact of stories in different cybersecurity contexts,
            including passwords, two-factor authentication, and for my central involvement, email. I was involved in
            three parts of this research project: coding security stories told in a survey study, aiding in
            transcription for a non-expert security decision making interview study, and spent most of my involvement
            developing and implementing an experimental protocol to test how story-based training affecting click rates
            on phishing emails. I began working on the experiment in May of 2020 and began running it in November of
            2020.</p>

          <h4 class="boxHeadline">Process</h4>
          <p class="boxText">The process of designing and actualizing an experiment took place in four main parts, which
            overlapped when problems arose and it became necessary to return to a previous step. First, I engaged in
            literature review and learning about phishing emails, training, susceptibility, and experimental protocols.
            During this process, I gained a feel for the common problems, ethical concerns, gaps, and standards in the
            area of study. I revisited literature during all parts of the study, and I used it as a way to better inform
            my approach to problems that arose, along with consulting with my mentor, Dr. Wash. <br><br> After the
            initial period of learning, I focused on developing a research question, hypothesis, and experiment design
            that would be most useful and feasible given our financial, time, and ethical constraints. After initially
            coming up with an experiment design, there was a long process going back and forth between design and
            development. During this period, I work with Dr. Wash and Norbert (a post-doctoral student working on the
            same grant) to address the technology side of running the experiment. I presented <a href="https://youtu.be/CROgCbMWju4">my progress at the
            Mid Michigan Symposium for Undergraduate Research Experiences</a>. <br><br> At the beginning of the fall, I did
            several iterations of pilot testing, including running the study myself and doing a soft launch with ten
            participants to work out the kinks in the technology before moving on to the actual study launch. During the study,
            I monitored the recruitment and data collection process to watch for problems. After data collection concluded,
            I used RStudio to analyze participant data from surveys as well as data about emails they clicked on before
            and after training. Following this data analysis, I presented <a href="https://youtu.be/MiMyjlXbXFU">my findings at the University Undergraduate Research
            and Arts Forum.</a></p>

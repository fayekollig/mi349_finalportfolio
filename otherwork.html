            <p><strong>ITM 444: IT CAPSTONE</strong></p>
            <p>For this project, I worked with a team with a real-world client to complete a rebranding of their company, Symbiosis International,
              as well as their affiliated nonprofit, Stem For All. I was responsible for a heuristic evaluation of the website, developing brand kits
              for each, creating social media assets (including the posters above), and a Canva Pro analysis. Click on the image above to view the full report.

        <p>I reworked the SSN logo in order to give it a more clean appearance and to match in font and color with
          the other assets I had been using for our social media accounts.
          This logo is being used on our <a href="https://www.spartansupportnetwork.org/" target="_blank">
          website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spartansupportnetwork/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
          and on our promotional materials during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years.

        <h4>Let's talk about...</h4>
        <p>I began "Let's talk about..." as a part of the organization's goal to provide information about relevant mental wellbeing
          topics. I took topic ideas from other members and researched them to put together concise, actionable posts, designed to be
          shared to people's Instagram stories to quickly spread information. This image shows four slides from a post on imposter
          syndrome. Other topics included <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIATDRlu3R/" target="_blank">coping with grief</a> and

        <p>As part of a collaboration with the University Activities Board, Residence Hall Association, and other on-campus groups,

          was printed and included in self-care kits put together by the UAB and made available for students on-campus.

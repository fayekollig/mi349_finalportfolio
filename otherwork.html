          <p class="boxText"><a href="https://www.spartansupportnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Spartan Support
              Network</a> is a student-led organization on MSU campus dedicated to providing safe spaces for students to
            talk openly and form genuine connections. It was founded in 2017 as a branch of the non-profit The Support
            Network, that facilitates and supports branches in (as of Fall 2020) eight schools across the country. The
            organization hosts weekly groups that take place at several times on several nights throughout the week that
            any MSU student can join. The weekly groups are led by group leaders, and the group leaders are supported
            and led by a board of directors. <br><br> I was involved with SSN for two years, first as a member and then a group
            leader, before becoming the director of marketing. The scope of this position involved managing apparel,
            outreach, and social media. Prior to the summer of 2020, SSN had not had a cohesive visual brand that was
            developed consistently across its internet presence.</p>

          <h4 class="boxHeadline">Process</h4>
          <p class="boxText">As a part of my original interview process, I developed a marketing strategy to improve
            engagement and following on our Instagram and Facebook platforms. Beginning in May of 2020, I developed a
            unique visual brand for SSN, using a specific font package, color palette, and logo to unify the appearance
            of our posts. I sought direction from comparable social media presences of organization like Mental Health
            America, other MSU organizations, and other branches of The Support Network, along with conversations with
            the rest of the SSN directors, to develop a content strategy for SSN that fit with our mission statement and
            the role we wanted to play on campus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="projectBox">
          <p class="boxText">Throughout my time in this position, I have designed
            and implemented several Instagram and Facebook campaigns that aligned with our values as an organization,
            including content for Mental Health Awareness Month, Black Mental Health Awareness Month, BIPOC Mental
            Health Month, Leader Spotlight Saturdays, Monday Positivity, and a series of “Let’s Talk About it” posts
            focusing on student mental wellness topics. Outside of posts, I also sought to build our presence on campus
            as a mental wellness resource, and throughout the fall semester we have worked with or interfaced with
            organizations like the University Activities Board, ASMSU, Love Yourself Clothing, Impact Radio, OCAT, and
            Broad Student Orgs.</p>

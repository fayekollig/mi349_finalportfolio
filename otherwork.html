        <h4>Logo Redesign</h4>
        <p>I reworked the SSN logo in order to give it a more clean appearance and to match in font and color with
          the other assets I had been using for our social media accounts.
          This logo is being used on our <a href="https://www.spartansupportnetwork.org/" target="_blank">
          website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spartansupportnetwork/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
          and on our promotional materials during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years.

        <h4>Let's talk about...</h4>
        <p>I began "Let's talk about..." as a part of the organization's goal to provide information about relevant mental wellbeing
          topics. I took topic ideas from other members and researched them to put together concise, actionable posts, designed to be
          shared to people's Instagram stories to quickly spread information. This image shows four slides from a post on imposter
          syndrome. Other topics included <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIATDRlu3R/" target="_blank">coping with grief</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGA_DUalQLs/" target="_blank">burnout</a>.

        <h4>Promotional Poster</h4>
        <p>I designed this logo and poster using pencil, paper, and watercolor, and then traced it in Photoshop. This poster was printed 
          and hung around campus to promote the organization during the school year.

        <h4>Election Stress Poster</h4>
        <p>As part of a collaboration with the University Activities Board, Residence Hall Association, and other on-campus groups,
          I designed a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHIUXOrl3sO/" target="_blank">social media post</a> and this poster with tips for coping with stress related to the November 2020 election. The poster
          was printed and included in self-care kits put together by the UAB and made available for students on-campus.

        <h4>Logo Redesign Ideas for Mi Element</h4>
        <p>Inspired by the homey, retro feel of one of my favorite local coffee shops, I created some ideas for their
          logo and some of their branding as a personal project in Photoshop.

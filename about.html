    <h2>Faye Kollig</h2>
    <h3>Student of Media & Information, Spanish, and Information Technology</h3>
    <p class="researchSubhead">Michigan State University, 2022</p>
    <p class="aboutMe">I grew up loving storytelling, writing songs and poems in the margins of my notebooks, and my first love was for journalism,
      inspired by listening to NPR in the car on the way to school every morning. As I've grown, my need to understand all
      sides of the story has turned into an interest in human-centered technology and design that appreciates all users. I am
      interested in pursuing a graduate degree in human-computer interaction, merging my love of research with my desire
      to make the world more understanding and accepting of diverse people. I have in-class experience with user research methods,
      design, web development, and Spanish, and research experience studying social cybersecurity and online communities.
      <br><br>In my free time, I love drawing (Sharpies and watercolors), cooking (mostly Italian), and walking. </p>

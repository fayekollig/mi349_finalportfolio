    <h2>Faye Elisabeth Kollig</h2>
    <h3>Student of Media & Information, Spanish, and Information Technology</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">Michigan State University, 2022</p>
    <p>With in-class experience in developing and evaluating human-centered technology as well as real-world experience
      studying social cybersecurity & online communities, I am a student of how real people use technology. I have a
      solid grounding in programming, marketing, Spanish, and design, and throughout my life Iâ€™ve loved storytelling,
      learning all sides of the story, and building meaningful connections with the people around me. Combining my
      interest in computers with my interest in humanity, I want to pursue a career in web development, research and
      design that will allow me to collaborate with others, learn about new ways of thinking and designing, and develop
      innovative solutions for the end user.</p>
